Data visualisations created with recharts library. The data comes from the European Parliament website. This is a personal project developed for learning purposes. I've used three types or charts from Recharts library in form of personalized reusable components. The user can filter the data, select units for each chart or even switch between different chart types.
Everything is styled with Bulma (with few customizations).
